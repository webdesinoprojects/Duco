- ✅ **Image Upload**: Users can upload custom images
- ✅ **Design Preview**: Real-time preview of designs
- ✅ **Multi-side Design**: Front, back, left, right design areas
- ✅ **Design Persistence**: Designs are saved and preserved

### **Backend (Enhanced Processing)**

- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: Works even when Printrove API fails

## 🔧 **Key Features Implemented:**

### **1. Text Processing**

```javascript
// Text data structure
{
  front: {
    customText: 'My Custom Text',
    textSize: 24,
    textColor: '#000000',
    font: 'font-sans',
    position: { x: 50, y: 30 }
  },
  back: {
    customText: 'Back Text',
    textSize: 20,
    textColor: '#FFFFFF',
    font: 'font-serif',
    position: { x: 50, y: 50 }
  }
}
```

### **2. Design Summary Generation**

```javascript
// Generated design summary
{
  type: 'custom-design',
  hasText: true,
  hasImages: true,
  textCount: 2,
  imageCount: 1,
  frontText: 'My Custom Text',
  backText: 'Back Text',
  summary: 'Front: "My Custom Text", Back: "Back Text", 1 image(s)'
}
```

### **3. Print Instructions**

```javascript
// Print instructions for fulfillment
{
  front: {
    hasText: true,
    textContent: 'My Custom Text',
    textColor: '#000000',
    textSize: 24
  },
  back: {
    hasText: true,
    textContent: 'Back Text',
    textColor: '#FFFFFF',
    textSize: 20
  },
  specialInstructions: [
    'Custom text printing required',
    'Custom image printing required'
  ]
}
```
